|**2024-01-19**|**Character Recognition in Byzantine Seals with Deep Neural Networks**|Seals are small coin-shaped artifacts, mostly made of lead, held with strings to seal letters. This work presents the first attempt towards automatic reading of text on Byzantine seal images.Byzantine seals are generally decorated with iconography on the obverse side and Greek text on the reverse side. Text may include the sender's name, position in the Byzantine aristocracy, and elements of prayers. Both text and iconography are precious literary sources that wait to be exploited electronically, so the development of computerized systems for interpreting seals images is of paramount importance. This work's contribution is hence a deep, two-stages, character reading pipeline for transcribing Byzantine seal images. A first deep convolutional neural network (CNN) detects characters in the seal (character localization). A second convolutional network reads the localized characters (character classification). Finally, a diplomatic transcription of the seal is provided by post-processing the two network outputs. We provide an experimental evaluation of each CNN in isolation and both CNNs in combination. All performances are evaluated by cross-validation. Character localization achieves a mean average precision (mAP@0.5) greater than 0.9. Classification of characters cropped from ground truth bounding boxes achieves Top-1 accuracy greater than 0.92. End-to-end evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed approach when compared to the SoTA for similar tasks.|[2401.10741](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10741)|
|**2024-01-16**|**BanglaNet: Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition using Ensembling of Convolutional Neural Network**|Handwritten character recognition is a crucial task because of its abundant applications. The recognition task of Bangla handwritten characters is especially challenging because of the cursive nature of Bangla characters and the presence of compound characters with more than one way of writing. In this paper, a classification model based on the ensembling of several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), namely, BanglaNet is proposed to classify Bangla basic characters, compound characters, numerals, and modifiers. Three different models based on the idea of state-of-the-art CNN models like Inception, ResNet, and DenseNet have been trained with both augmented and non-augmented inputs. Finally, all these models are averaged or ensembled to get the finishing model. Rigorous experimentation on three benchmark Bangla handwritten characters datasets, namely, CMATERdb, BanglaLekha-Isolated, and Ekush has exhibited significant recognition accuracies compared to some recent CNN-based research. The top-1 recognition accuracies obtained are 98.40%, 97.65%, and 97.32%, and the top-3 accuracies are 99.79%, 99.74%, and 99.56% for CMATERdb, BanglaLekha-Isolated, and Ekush datasets respectively.|[2401.08035](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08035)|
|**2024-01-15**|**Improving OCR Quality in 19th Century Historical Documents Using a Combined Machine Learning Based Approach**|This paper addresses a major challenge to historical research on the 19th century. Large quantities of sources have become digitally available for the first time, while extraction techniques are lagging behind. Therefore, we researched machine learning (ML) models to recognise and extract complex data structures in a high-value historical primary source, the Schematismus. It records every single person in the Habsburg civil service above a certain hierarchical level between 1702 and 1918 and documents the genesis of the central administration over two centuries. Its complex and intricate structure as well as its enormous size have so far made any more comprehensive analysis of the administrative and social structure of the later Habsburg Empire on the basis of this source impossible. We pursued two central objectives: Primarily, the improvement of the OCR quality, for which we considered an improved structure recognition to be essential; in the further course, it turned out that this also made the extraction of the data structure possible. We chose Faster R-CNN as base for the ML architecture for structure recognition. In order to obtain the required amount of training data quickly and economically, we synthesised Hof- und Staatsschematismus-style data, which we used to train our model. The model was then fine-tuned with a smaller set of manually annotated historical source data. We then used Tesseract-OCR, which was further optimised for the style of our documents, to complete the combined structure extraction and OCR process. Results show a significant decrease in the two standard parameters of OCR-performance, WER and CER (where lower values are better). Combined structure detection and fine-tuned OCR improved CER and WER values by remarkable 71.98 percent (CER) respectively 52.49 percent (WER).|[2401.07787](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07787)|
|**2024-01-07**|**Re:Draw -- Context Aware Translation as a Controllable Method for Artistic Production**|We introduce context-aware translation, a novel method that combines the benefits of inpainting and image-to-image translation, respecting simultaneously the original input and contextual relevance -- where existing methods fall short. By doing so, our method opens new avenues for the controllable use of AI within artistic creation, from animation to digital art.   As an use case, we apply our method to redraw any hand-drawn animated character eyes based on any design specifications - eyes serve as a focal point that captures viewer attention and conveys a range of emotions, however, the labor-intensive nature of traditional animation often leads to compromises in the complexity and consistency of eye design. Furthermore, we remove the need for production data for training and introduce a new character recognition method that surpasses existing work by not requiring fine-tuning to specific productions. This proposed use case could help maintain consistency throughout production and unlock bolder and more detailed design choices without the production cost drawbacks. A user study shows context-aware translation is preferred over existing work 95.16% of the time.|[2401.03499](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03499)|
|**2024-01-01**|**Efficient Multi-domain Text Recognition Deep Neural Network Parameterization with Residual Adapters**|Recent advancements in deep neural networks have markedly enhanced the performance of computer vision tasks, yet the specialized nature of these networks often necessitates extensive data and high computational power. Addressing these requirements, this study presents a novel neural network model adept at optical character recognition (OCR) across diverse domains, leveraging the strengths of multi-task learning to improve efficiency and generalization. The model is designed to achieve rapid adaptation to new domains, maintain a compact size conducive to reduced computational resource demand, ensure high accuracy, retain knowledge from previous learning experiences, and allow for domain-specific performance improvements without the need to retrain entirely. Rigorous evaluation on open datasets has validated the model's ability to significantly lower the number of trainable parameters without sacrificing performance, indicating its potential as a scalable and adaptable solution in the field of computer vision, particularly for applications in optical text recognition.|[2401.00971](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00971)|
|**2023-12-31**|**Bidirectional Trained Tree-Structured Decoder for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition**|The Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) task is a critical branch in the field of OCR. Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating bidirectional context information significantly improves the performance of HMER models. However, existing methods fail to effectively utilize bidirectional context information during the inference stage. Furthermore, current bidirectional training methods are primarily designed for string decoders and cannot adequately generalize to tree decoders, which offer superior generalization capabilities and structural analysis capacity. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose the Mirror-Flipped Symbol Layout Tree (MF-SLT) and Bidirectional Asynchronous Training (BAT) structure. Our method extends the bidirectional training strategy to the tree decoder, allowing for more effective training by leveraging bidirectional information. Additionally, we analyze the impact of the visual and linguistic perception of the HMER model separately and introduce the Shared Language Modeling (SLM) mechanism. Through the SLM, we enhance the model's robustness and generalization when dealing with visual ambiguity, particularly in scenarios with abundant training data. Our approach has been validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its ability to achieve new state-of-the-art results on the CROHME 2014, 2016, and 2019 datasets, as well as the HME100K dataset. The code used in our experiments will be publicly available.|[2401.00435](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00435)|
|**2024-01-02**|**Large OCR Model:An Empirical Study of Scaling Law for OCR**|The laws of model size, data volume, computation and model performance have been extensively studied in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the scaling laws in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) have not yet been investigated. To address this, we conducted comprehensive studies that involved examining the correlation between performance and the scale of models, data volume and computation in the field of text recognition.Conclusively, the study demonstrates smooth power laws between performance and model size, as well as training data volume, when other influencing factors are held constant. Additionally, we have constructed a large-scale dataset called REBU-Syn, which comprises 6 million real samples and 18 million synthetic samples. Based on our scaling law and new dataset, we have successfully trained a scene text recognition model, achieving a new state-ofthe-art on 6 common test benchmarks with a top-1 average accuracy of 97.42%.|[2401.00028](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00028)|
|**2023-12-28**|**Chaurah: A Smart Raspberry Pi based Parking System**|The widespread usage of cars and other large, heavy vehicles necessitates the development of an effective parking infrastructure. Additionally, algorithms for detection and recognition of number plates are often used to identify automobiles all around the world where standardized plate sizes and fonts are enforced, making recognition an effortless task. As a result, both kinds of data can be combined to develop an intelligent parking system focuses on the technology of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR). Retrieving characters from an inputted number plate image is the sole purpose of ANPR which is a costly procedure. In this article, we propose Chaurah, a minimal cost ANPR system that relies on a Raspberry Pi 3 that was specifically created for parking facilities. The system employs a dual-stage methodology, with the first stage being an ANPR system which makes use of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The primary locates and recognises license plates from a vehicle image, while the secondary performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify individualized numbers from the number plate. An application built with Flutter and Firebase for database administration and license plate record comparison makes up the second component of the overall solution. The application also acts as an user-interface for the billing mechanism based on parking time duration resulting in an all-encompassing software deployment of the study.|[2312.16894](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16894)|
|**2023-12-20**|**Segmenting Messy Text: Detecting Boundaries in Text Derived from Historical Newspaper Images**|Text segmentation, the task of dividing a document into sections, is often a prerequisite for performing additional natural language processing tasks. Existing text segmentation methods have typically been developed and tested using clean, narrative-style text with segments containing distinct topics. Here we consider a challenging text segmentation task: dividing newspaper marriage announcement lists into units of one announcement each. In many cases the information is not structured into sentences, and adjacent segments are not topically distinct from each other. In addition, the text of the announcements, which is derived from images of historical newspapers via optical character recognition, contains many typographical errors. As a result, these announcements are not amenable to segmentation with existing techniques. We present a novel deep learning-based model for segmenting such text and show that it significantly outperforms an existing state-of-the-art method on our task.|[2312.12773](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12773)|
|**2023-12-19**|**Advancements and Challenges in Arabic Optical Character Recognition: A Comprehensive Survey**|Optical character recognition (OCR) is a vital process that involves the extraction of handwritten or printed text from scanned or printed images, converting it into a format that can be understood and processed by machines. This enables further data processing activities such as searching and editing. The automatic extraction of text through OCR plays a crucial role in digitizing documents, enhancing productivity, improving accessibility, and preserving historical records. This paper seeks to offer an exhaustive review of contemporary applications, methodologies, and challenges associated with Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR). A thorough analysis is conducted on prevailing techniques utilized throughout the OCR process, with a dedicated effort to discern the most efficacious approaches that demonstrate enhanced outcomes. To ensure a thorough evaluation, a meticulous keyword-search methodology is adopted, encompassing a comprehensive analysis of articles relevant to Arabic OCR, including both backward and forward citation reviews. In addition to presenting cutting-edge techniques and methods, this paper critically identifies research gaps within the realm of Arabic OCR. By highlighting these gaps, we shed light on potential areas for future exploration and development, thereby guiding researchers toward promising avenues in the field of Arabic OCR. The outcomes of this study provide valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders involved in Arabic OCR, ultimately fostering advancements in the field and facilitating the creation of more accurate and efficient OCR systems for the Arabic language.|[2312.11812](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11812)|
|**2023-12-18**|**TDeLTA: A Light-weight and Robust Table Detection Method based on Learning Text Arrangement**|The diversity of tables makes table detection a great challenge, leading to existing models becoming more tedious and complex. Despite achieving high performance, they often overfit to the table style in training set, and suffer from significant performance degradation when encountering out-of-distribution tables in other domains. To tackle this problem, we start from the essence of the table, which is a set of text arranged in rows and columns. Based on this, we propose a novel, light-weighted and robust Table Detection method based on Learning Text Arrangement, namely TDeLTA. TDeLTA takes the text blocks as input, and then models the arrangement of them with a sequential encoder and an attention module. To locate the tables precisely, we design a text-classification task, classifying the text blocks into 4 categories according to their semantic roles in the tables. Experiments are conducted on both the text blocks parsed from PDF and extracted by open-source OCR tools, respectively. Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, TDeLTA achieves competitive results with only 3.1M model parameters on the large-scale public datasets. Moreover, when faced with the cross-domain data under the 0-shot setting, TDeLTA outperforms baselines by a large margin of nearly 7%, which shows the strong robustness and transferability of the proposed model.|[2312.11043](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11043)|
|**2023-12-16**|**When Graph Data Meets Multimodal: A New Paradigm for Graph Understanding and Reasoning**|Graph data is ubiquitous in the physical world, and it has always been a challenge to efficiently model graph structures using a unified paradigm for the understanding and reasoning on various graphs. Moreover, in the era of large language models, integrating complex graph information into text sequences has become exceptionally difficult, which hinders the ability to interact with graph data through natural language instructions.The paper presents a new paradigm for understanding and reasoning about graph data by integrating image encoding and multimodal technologies. This approach enables the comprehension of graph data through an instruction-response format, utilizing GPT-4V's advanced capabilities. The study evaluates this paradigm on various graph types, highlighting the model's strengths and weaknesses, particularly in Chinese OCR performance and complex reasoning tasks. The findings suggest new direction for enhancing graph data processing and natural language interaction.|[2312.10372](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10372)|

|**2023-12-15**|**Privacy-Aware Document Visual Question Answering**|Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) is a fast growing branch of document understanding. Despite the fact that documents contain sensitive or copyrighted information, none of the current DocVQA methods offers strong privacy guarantees.   In this work, we explore privacy in the domain of DocVQA for the first time. We highlight privacy issues in state of the art multi-modal LLM models used for DocVQA, and explore possible solutions.   Specifically, we focus on the invoice processing use case as a realistic, widely used scenario for document understanding, and propose a large scale DocVQA dataset comprising invoice documents and associated questions and answers. We employ a federated learning scheme, that reflects the real-life distribution of documents in different businesses, and we explore the use case where the ID of the invoice issuer is the sensitive information to be protected.   We demonstrate that non-private models tend to memorise, behaviour that can lead to exposing private information. We then evaluate baseline training schemes employing federated learning and differential privacy in this multi-modal scenario, where the sensitive information might be exposed through any of the two input modalities: vision (document image) or language (OCR tokens).   Finally, we design an attack exploiting the memorisation effect of the model, and demonstrate its effectiveness in probing different DocVQA models.|[2312.10108](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10108)|
|**2023-12-13**|**Polar-Doc: One-Stage Document Dewarping with Multi-Scope Constraints under Polar Representation**|Document dewarping, aiming to eliminate geometric deformation in photographed documents to benefit text recognition, has made great progress in recent years but is still far from being solved. While Cartesian coordinates are typically leveraged by state-of-the-art approaches to learn a group of deformation control points, such representation is not efficient for dewarping model to learn the deformation information. In this work, we explore Polar coordinates representation for each point in document dewarping, namely Polar-Doc. In contrast to most current works adopting a two-stage pipeline typically, Polar representation enables a unified point regression framework for both segmentation and dewarping network in one single stage. Such unification makes the whole model more efficient to learn under an end-to-end optimization pipeline, and also obtains a compact representation. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-scope Polar-Doc-IOU loss to constrain the relationship among control points as a grid-based regularization under the Polar representation. Visual comparisons and quantitative experiments on two benchmarks show that, with much fewer parameters than the other mainstream counterparts, our one-stage model with multi-scope constraints achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both pixel alignment metrics and OCR metrics.

In this research, we propose a multimodal framework that integrates visual and textual features to predict the GIF sentiment. It also incorporates attributes including face emotion detection and OCR generated captions to capture the semantic aspects of the GIF. The developed classifier achieves an accuracy of 82.7% on Twitter GIFs, which is an improvement over state-of-the-art models.

Digital medication intake reminder solutions with minimal onboarding requirements that are usable at the point of medication acquisition may help to alleviate this problem by offering a low barrier way to help people remember to take their medications. In this paper, we propose memorAIs, a digital medication intake reminder solution that mitigates onboarding friction by leveraging optical character recognition strategies for text extraction from medication bottles and rule based expressions for text processing to create configured medication reminders as local device calendar invitations.

|**2023-12-11**|**Vary: Scaling up the Vision Vocabulary for Large Vision-Language Models**|Modern Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enjoy the same vision vocabulary -- CLIP, which can cover most common vision tasks. However, for some special vision task that needs dense and fine-grained vision perception, e.g., document-level OCR or chart understanding, especially in non-English scenarios, the CLIP-style vocabulary may encounter low efficiency in tokenizing the vision knowledge and even suffer out-of-vocabulary problem. Accordingly, we propose Vary, an efficient and effective method to scale up the vision vocabulary of LVLMs. The procedures of Vary are naturally divided into two folds: the generation and integration of a new vision vocabulary. In the first phase, we devise a vocabulary network along with a tiny decoder-only transformer to produce the desired vocabulary via autoregression. In the next, we scale up the vanilla vision vocabulary by merging the new one with the original one (CLIP), enabling the LVLMs can quickly garner new features. Compared to the popular BLIP-2, MiniGPT4, and LLaVA, Vary can maintain its vanilla capabilities while enjoying more excellent fine-grained perception and understanding ability. Specifically, Vary is competent in new document parsing features (OCR or markdown conversion) while achieving 78.2% ANLS in DocVQA and 36.2% in MMVet.

However, real-world scanned oracle characters are difficult to collect and annotate, posing a major obstacle for oracle character recognition (OrCR). Besides, serious abrasion and inter-class similarity also make OrCR more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method for OrCR, which enables to transfer knowledge from labeled handprinted oracle characters to unlabeled scanned data. We leverage pseudo-labeling to incorporate the semantic information into adaptation and constrain augmentation consistency to make the predictions of scanned samples consistent under different perturbations, leading to the model robustness to abrasion, stain and distortion. Simultaneously, an unsupervised transition loss is proposed to learn more discriminative features on the scanned domain by optimizing both between-class and within-class transition probability. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art result on Oracle-241 dataset and substantially outperforms the recently proposed structure-texture separation network by 15.1%.|[2312.06075](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06075)|

Manual methods for tracking vehicles and finding parking spaces are slow and a waste of time. To solve the problem of auto management of vehicle entrance and parking, we have utilized state-of-the-art deep learning models and automated the process of vehicle entrance and parking into any organization. To ensure security, our system integrated vehicle detection, license number plate verification, and face detection and recognition models to ensure that the person and vehicle are registered with the organization. We have trained multiple deep-learning models for vehicle detection, license number plate detection, face detection, and recognition, however, the YOLOv8n model outperformed all the other models. Furthermore, License plate recognition is facilitated by Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. By integrating these technologies, the system offers efficient vehicle detection, precise identification, streamlined record keeping, and optimized parking slot allocation in buildings, thereby enhancing convenience, accuracy, and security. Future research opportunities lie in fine-tuning system performance for a wide range of real-world applications.|[2312.02699](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02699)|

For this reason the `ICDAR 2023 Competition on Detection and Recognition of Greek Letters on Papyri' was held as part of the 17th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition. This paper discusses our submission to the competition. We used an ensemble of YOLOv8 models to detect and classify individual characters and employed two different approaches for refining the character predictions, including a transformer based DeiT approach and a ResNet-50 model trained on a large corpus of unlabelled data using SimCLR, a self-supervised learning method. Our submission won the recognition challenge with a mAP of 42.2%, and was runner-up in the detection challenge with a mean average precision (mAP) of 51.4%. At the more relaxed intersection over union threshold of 0.5, we achieved the highest mean average precision and mean average recall results for both detection and classification. We ran our prediction pipeline on more than 4,500 images from the Oxyrhynchus Papyri to illustrate the utility of our approach, and we release the results publicly in multiple formats.|[2401.12513](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12513)|

To comprehensively analyze hierarchical document structures, we propose a tree construction based approach that addresses multiple subtasks concurrently, including page object detection (Detect), reading order prediction of identified objects (Order), and the construction of intended hierarchical structure (Construct). We present an effective end-to-end solution based on this framework to demonstrate its performance. To assess our approach, we develop a comprehensive benchmark called Comp-HRDoc, which evaluates the above subtasks simultaneously. Our end-to-end system achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale document layout analysis datasets (PubLayNet and DocLayNet), a high-quality hierarchical document structure reconstruction dataset (HRDoc), and our Comp-HRDoc benchmark.

|**2024-01-22**|**A Fair Evaluation of Various Deep Learning-Based Document Image Binarization Approaches**|Binarization of document images is an important pre-processing step in the field of document analysis. Traditional image binarization techniques usually rely on histograms or local statistics to identify a valid threshold to differentiate between different aspects of the image. Deep learning techniques are able to generate binarized versions of the images by learning context-dependent features that are less error-prone to degradation typically occurring in document images. In recent years, many deep learning-based methods have been developed for document binarization. But which one to choose? There have been no studies that compare these methods rigorously. Therefore, this work focuses on the evaluation of different deep learning-based methods under the same evaluation protocol. We evaluate them on different Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets and obtain very heterogeneous results. We show that the DE-GAN model was able to perform better compared to other models when evaluated on the DIBCO2013 dataset while DP-LinkNet performed best on the DIBCO2017 dataset. The 2-StageGAN performed best on the DIBCO2018 dataset while SauvolaNet outperformed the others on the DIBCO2019 challenge. Finally, we make the code, all models and evaluation publicly available (https://github.com/RichSu95/Document_Binarization_Collection) to ensure reproducibility and simplify future binarization evaluations.|[2401.11831](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11831)|
|**2024-01-16**|**U-DIADS-Bib: a full and few-shot pixel-precise dataset for document layout analysis of ancient manuscripts**|Document Layout Analysis, which is the task of identifying different semantic regions inside of a document page, is a subject of great interest for both computer scientists and humanities scholars as it represents a fundamental step towards further analysis tasks for the former and a powerful tool to improve and facilitate the study of the documents for the latter. However, many of the works currently present in the literature, especially when it comes to the available datasets, fail to meet the needs of both worlds and, in particular, tend to lean towards the needs and common practices of the computer science side, leading to resources that are not representative of the humanities real needs. For this reason, the present paper introduces U-DIADS-Bib, a novel, pixel-precise, non-overlapping and noiseless document layout analysis dataset developed in close collaboration between specialists in the fields of computer vision and humanities. Furthermore, we propose a novel, computer-aided, segmentation pipeline in order to alleviate the burden represented by the time-consuming process of manual annotation, necessary for the generation of the ground truth segmentation maps. Finally, we present a standardized few-shot version of the dataset (U-DIADS-BibFS), with the aim of encouraging the development of models and solutions able to address this task with as few samples as possible, which would allow for more effective use in a real-world scenario, where collecting a large number of segmentations is not always feasible.|[2401.08425](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08425)|

Firstly, this study addresses these challenges, recognizing early CPC work while acknowledging past struggles with language barriers and document intricacy. Secondly, it underscores the persisting difficulties of CPC research.   To overcome these challenges and bolster the CPC system, This paper presents two key innovations. Firstly, it introduces an ensemble approach that incorporates four BERT-related models, enhancing semantic similarity accuracy through weighted averaging. Secondly, a novel text preprocessing method tailored for patent documents is introduced, featuring a distinctive input structure with token scoring that aids in capturing semantic relationships during CPC context training, utilizing BCELoss.

Besides, these data-driven approaches impose an urgent demand for massive data annotations, which are laborious and time-consuming. For the first problem, we propose an orthogonal plane disentanglement network (termed DOPNet) to distinguish ambiguous semantics. DOPNet consists of three modules that are integrated to deliver distortion-free, semantics-clean, and detail-sharp disentangled representations, which benefit the subsequent layout recovery. For the second problem, we present an unsupervised adaptation technique tailored for horizon-depth and ratio representations. Concretely, we introduce an optimization strategy for decision-level layout analysis and a 1D cost volume construction method for feature-level multi-view aggregation, both of which are designed to fully exploit the geometric consistency across multiple perspectives. The optimizer provides a reliable set of pseudo-labels for network training, while the 1D cost volume enriches each view with comprehensive scene information derived from other perspectives.

There is no lingua franca shared among OMR datasets that allows to compare systems' performance on equal grounds, since most of them are specialised on certain approaches. As a result, most state-of-the-art works currently report metrics that cannot be compared directly. In this paper we identify the need of a common music representation language and propose the Music Tree Notation (MTN) format, thanks to which the definition of standard metrics is possible. This format represents music as a set of primitives that group together into higher-abstraction nodes, a compromise between the expression of fully graph-based and sequential notation formats. We have also developed a specific set of OMR metrics and a typeset score dataset as a proof of concept of this idea.|[2312.12908](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12908)|
|**2024-01-21**|**Topic-VQ-VAE: Leveraging Latent Codebooks for Flexible Topic-Guided Document Generation**|This paper introduces a novel approach for topic modeling utilizing latent codebooks from Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder~(VQ-VAE), discretely encapsulating the rich information of the pre-trained embeddings such as the pre-trained language model. From the novel interpretation of the latent codebooks and embeddings as conceptual bag-of-words, we propose a new generative topic model called Topic-VQ-VAE~(TVQ-VAE) which inversely generates the original documents related to the respective latent codebook. The TVQ-VAE can visualize the topics with various generative distributions including the traditional BoW distribution and the autoregressive image generation. Our experimental results on document analysis and image generation demonstrate that TVQ-VAE effectively captures the topic context which reveals the underlying structures of the dataset and supports flexible forms of document generation. Official implementation of the proposed TVQ-VAE is available at https://github.com/clovaai/TVQ-VAE.|[2312.11532](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11532)|
|**2023-12-15**|**Object Recognition from Scientific Document based on Compartment Refinement Framework**|With the rapid development of the internet in the past decade, it has become increasingly important to extract valuable information from vast resources efficiently, which is crucial for establishing a comprehensive digital ecosystem, particularly in the context of research surveys and comprehension. The foundation of these tasks focuses on accurate extraction and deep mining of data from scientific documents, which are essential for building a robust data infrastructure. However, parsing raw data or extracting data from complex scientific documents have been ongoing challenges. Current data extraction methods for scientific documents typically use rule-based (RB) or machine learning (ML) approaches. However, using rule-based methods can incur high coding costs for articles with intricate typesetting. Conversely, relying solely on machine learning methods necessitates annotation work for complex content types within the scientific document, which can be costly. Additionally, few studies have thoroughly defined and explored the hierarchical layout within scientific documents. The lack of a comprehensive definition of the internal structure and elements of the documents indirectly impacts the accuracy of text classification and object recognition tasks. From the perspective of analyzing the standard layout and typesetting used in the specified publication, we propose a new document layout analysis framework called CTBR(Compartment & Text Blocks Refinement). Firstly, we define scientific documents into hierarchical divisions: base domain, compartment, and text blocks. Next, we conduct an in-depth exploration and classification of the meanings of text blocks. Finally, we utilize the results of text block classification to implement object recognition within scientific documents based on rule-based compartment segmentation.|[2312.09038](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09038)|
|**2023-12-13**|**A Deep Learning-Based System for Automatic Case Summarization**|This paper presents a deep learning-based system for efficient automatic case summarization. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, the system offers both supervised and unsupervised methods to generate concise and relevant summaries of lengthy legal case documents. The user-friendly interface allows users to browse the system's database of legal case documents, select their desired case, and choose their preferred summarization method. The system generates comprehensive summaries for each subsection of the legal text as well as an overall summary. This demo streamlines legal case document analysis, potentially benefiting legal professionals by reducing workload and increasing efficiency. Future work will focus on refining summarization techniques and exploring the application of our methods to other types of legal texts.|[2312.07824](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07824)|
|**2023-12-08**|**Towards Controlled Table-to-Text Generation with Scientific Reasoning**|The sheer volume of scientific experimental results and complex technical statements, often presented in tabular formats, presents a formidable barrier to individuals acquiring preferred information. The realms of scientific reasoning and content generation that adhere to user preferences encounter distinct challenges. In this work, we present a new task for generating fluent and logical descriptions that match user preferences over scientific tabular data, aiming to automate scientific document analysis. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct a new challenging dataset CTRLSciTab consisting of table-description pairs extracted from the scientific literature, with highlighted cells and corresponding domain-specific knowledge base. We evaluated popular pre-trained language models to establish a baseline and proposed a novel architecture outperforming competing approaches. The results showed that large models struggle to produce accurate content that aligns with user preferences. As the first of its kind, our work should motivate further research in scientific domains.|[2312.05402](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05402)|
|**2023-12-06**|**A Layer-Wise Tokens-to-Token Transformer Network for Improved Historical Document Image Enhancement**|Document image enhancement is a fundamental and important stage for attaining the best performance in any document analysis assignment because there are many degradation situations that could harm document images, making it more difficult to recognize and analyze them. In this paper, we propose \textbf{T2T-BinFormer} which is a novel document binarization encoder-decoder architecture based on a Tokens-to-token vision transformer. Each image is divided into a set of tokens with a defined length using the ViT model, which is then applied several times to model the global relationship between the tokens. However, the conventional tokenization of input data does not adequately reflect the crucial local structure between adjacent pixels of the input image, which results in low efficiency. Instead of using a simple ViT and hard splitting of images for the document image enhancement task, we employed a progressive tokenization technique to capture this local information from an image to achieve more effective results. Experiments on various DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the existing CNN and ViT-based state-of-the-art methods. In this research, the primary area of examination is the application of the proposed architecture to the task of document binarization. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/RisabBiswas/T2T-BinFormer.|[2312.03946](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03946)|
|**2023-12-06**|**DocBinFormer: A Two-Level Transformer Network for Effective Document Image Binarization**|In real life, various degradation scenarios exist that might damage document images, making it harder to recognize and analyze them, thus binarization is a fundamental and crucial step for achieving the most optimal performance in any document analysis task. We propose DocBinFormer (Document Binarization Transformer), a novel two-level vision transformer (TL-ViT) architecture based on vision transformers for effective document image binarization. The presented architecture employs a two-level transformer encoder to effectively capture both global and local feature representation from the input images. These complimentary bi-level features are exploited for efficient document image binarization, resulting in improved results for system-generated as well as handwritten document images in a comprehensive approach. With the absence of convolutional layers, the transformer encoder uses the pixel patches and sub-patches along with their positional information to operate directly on them, while the decoder generates a clean (binarized) output image from the latent representation of the patches. Instead of using a simple vision transformer block to extract information from the image patches, the proposed architecture uses two transformer blocks for greater coverage of the extracted feature space on a global and local scale. The encoded feature representation is used by the decoder block to generate the corresponding binarized output. Extensive experiments on a variety of DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four metrics. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/RisabBiswas/DocBinFormer.|[2312.03568](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03568)|
|**2023-11-29**|**DSS: Synthesizing long Digital Ink using Data augmentation, Style encoding and Split generation**|As text generative models can give increasingly long answers, we tackle the problem of synthesizing long text in digital ink. We show that the commonly used models for this task fail to generalize to long-form data and how this problem can be solved by augmenting the training data, changing the model architecture and the inference procedure. These methods use contrastive learning technique and are tailored specifically for the handwriting domain. They can be applied to any encoder-decoder model that works with digital ink. We demonstrate that our method reduces the character error rate on long-form English data by half compared to baseline RNN and by 16% compared to the previous approach that aims at addressing the same problem. We show that all three parts of the method improve recognizability of generated inks. In addition, we evaluate synthesized data in a human study and find that people perceive most of generated data as real.|[2311.17786](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17786)|
|**2023-11-27**|**Nova$^+$: Generative Language Models for Binaries**|Generative large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on code have shown impressive effectiveness in code generation, program repair, and document analysis. However, existing generative LLMs focus on source code and are not specialized for binaries. There are three main challenges for LLMs to model and learn binary code: hex-decimal values, complex global dependencies, and compiler optimization levels. To bring the benefit of LLMs to the binary domain, we develop Nova and Nova$^+$, which are LLMs pre-trained on binary corpora. Nova is pre-trained with the standard language modeling task, showing significantly better capability on five benchmarks for three downstream tasks: binary code similarity detection (BCSD), binary code translation (BCT), and binary code recovery (BCR), over GPT-3.5 and other existing techniques. We build Nova$^+$ to further boost Nova using two new pre-training tasks, i.e., optimization generation and optimization level prediction, which are designed to learn binary optimization and align equivalent binaries. Nova$^+$ shows overall the best performance for all three downstream tasks on five benchmarks, demonstrating the contributions of the new pre-training tasks.|[2311.13721](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13721)|
|**2023-11-22**|**ChemScraper: Graphics Extraction, Molecular Diagram Parsing, and Annotated Data Generation for PDF Images**|Existing visual parsers for molecule diagrams translate pixel-based raster images such as PNGs to chemical structure representations (e.g., SMILES). However, PDFs created by word processors including LaTeX and Word provide explicit locations and shapes for characters, lines, and polygons. We extract symbols from born-digital PDF molecule images and then apply simple graph transformations to capture both visual and chemical structure in editable ChemDraw files (CDXML). Our fast ( PDF $\rightarrow$ visual graph $\rightarrow$ chemical graph ) pipeline does not require GPUs, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or vectorization. We evaluate on standard benchmarks using SMILES strings, along with a novel evaluation that provides graph-based metrics and error compilation using LgEval. The geometric information in born-digital PDFs produces a highly accurate parser, motivating generating training data for visual parsers that recognize from raster images, with extracted graphics, visual structure, and chemical structure as annotations. To do this we render SMILES strings in Indigo, parse molecule structure, and then validate recognized structure to select correct files.|[2311.12161](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12161)|

This article provides analysis based on the triangulation of qualitative data gathered via document analysis and in-depth semi-structured expert interviews to gain insight into the involvement of the actors responsible for the negotiations that led to the Artemis Accords and their diplomatic communication style. The results identified different uses of public and private diplomatic communication for advancing norms of behaviour and transparency. Negotiators used public diplomatic communication in order to influence foreign governments on the need for norms of behaviour and transparency to further peaceful space exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Private diplomatic communication facilitated the inclusion of commercial partners.|[2311.12137](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12137)|
|**2023-11-20**|**FATURA: A Multi-Layout Invoice Image Dataset for Document Analysis and Understanding**|Document analysis and understanding models often require extensive annotated data to be trained. However, various document-related tasks extend beyond mere text transcription, requiring both textual content and precise bounding-box annotations to identify different document elements. Collecting such data becomes particularly challenging, especially in the context of invoices, where privacy concerns add an additional layer of complexity. In this paper, we introduce FATURA, a pivotal resource for researchers in the field of document analysis and understanding. FATURA is a highly diverse dataset featuring multi-layout, annotated invoice document images. Comprising $10,000$ invoices with $50$ distinct layouts, it represents the largest openly accessible image dataset of invoice documents known to date. We also provide comprehensive benchmarks for various document analysis and understanding tasks and conduct experiments under diverse training and evaluation scenarios. The dataset is freely accessible at https://zenodo.org/record/8261508, empowering researchers to advance the field of document analysis and understanding.|[2311.11856](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11856)|
|**2024-01-03**|**Evaluating LLMs on Document-Based QA: Exact Answer Selection and Numerical Extraction using Cogtale dataset**|Document-based Question-Answering (QA) tasks are crucial for precise information retrieval. While some existing work focus on evaluating large language models performance on retrieving and answering questions from documents, assessing the LLMs performance on QA types that require exact answer selection from predefined options and numerical extraction is yet to be fully assessed. In this paper, we specifically focus on this underexplored context and conduct empirical analysis of LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) on question types, including single-choice, yes-no, multiple-choice, and number extraction questions from documents in zero-shot setting. We use the CogTale dataset for evaluation, which provide human expert-tagged responses, offering a robust benchmark for precision and factual grounding. We found that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can precisely answer many single-choice and yes-no questions given relevant context, demonstrating their efficacy in information retrieval tasks. However, their performance diminishes when confronted with multiple-choice and number extraction formats, lowering the overall performance of the model on this task, indicating that these models may not yet be sufficiently reliable for the task. This limits the applications of LLMs on applications demanding precise information extraction from documents, such as meta-analysis tasks. These findings hinge on the assumption that the retrievers furnish pertinent context necessary for accurate responses, emphasizing the need for further research. Our work offers a framework for ongoing dataset evaluation, ensuring that LLM applications for information retrieval and document analysis continue to meet evolving standards.|[2311.07878](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07878)|
|**2023-10-31**|**HWD: A Novel Evaluation Score for Styled Handwritten Text Generation**|Styled Handwritten Text Generation (Styled HTG) is an important task in document analysis, aiming to generate text images with the handwriting of given reference images. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of deep learning models for tackling this task. Being able to measure the performance of HTG models via a meaningful and representative criterion is key for fostering the development of this research topic. However, despite the current adoption of scores for natural image generation evaluation, assessing the quality of generated handwriting remains challenging. In light of this, we devise the Handwriting Distance (HWD), tailored for HTG evaluation. In particular, it works in the feature space of a network specifically trained to extract handwriting style features from the variable-lenght input images and exploits a perceptual distance to compare the subtle geometric features of handwriting. Through extensive experimental evaluation on different word-level and line-level datasets of handwritten text images, we demonstrate the suitability of the proposed HWD as a score for Styled HTG. The pretrained model used as backbone will be released to ease the adoption of the score, aiming to provide a valuable tool for evaluating HTG models and thus contributing to advancing this important research area.|[2310.20316](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20316)|
